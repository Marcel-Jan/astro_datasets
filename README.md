# Astronomy and space related (downloadable) datasets

This is a list of astronomy and space related (downloadable if possible) datasets. When I'm learning new ways of working with data, I like to use astronomy and space related datasets to play with. For example, I used the asteroids dataset of the Minor Planet Center to learn how to use the pandas, matplotlib and sklearn libraries in Python (see https://youtu.be/iXjJNc8zGsM and https://youtu.be/mWxAq1NmKsU).
